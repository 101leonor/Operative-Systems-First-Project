The objective of this project is to develop the IST “Event Management System” (IST-EMS), a event management system that allows the creation, booking and verification of availability of tickets for events, such as concerts and theater shows.

IST-EMS explores parallelization techniques based on multiple processes and multiple tasks in order to speed up order processing. When developing IST-SEM the students will also learn how to implement scalable synchronization mechanisms between tasks as well as communication mechanisms between processes (FIFOs and signals). THE IST-EMS will also interact with the file system therefore offering the possibility of learning to use file system programming interfaces POSIX
